> A machine learning pipeline for detecting fine-scale behavioral events in bio-logging data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rstickleback from [GitHub](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/rstickleback) with:

```{r install}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FlukeAndFeather/rstickleback")
```

## Key concepts

* Behavioral events are brief behaviors that can be represented as a point in time, e.g. feeding or social interactions.
* High-resolution bio-logging data (e.g. from accelerometers and magnetometers) are multi-variate time series. Traditional classifiers struggle with time series data.
* `stickleback` takes a time series classification approach to detect behavioral events in longitudinal bio-logging data.

## Quick start

### Load sample data

The included sensor data contains the depth, pitch, roll, and speed of six blue whales at 10 Hz, and the event data contains the times of lunge-feeding behaviors.

```{r load_data}
lunge_data <- load_lunges()
lunge_sensors <- lunge_data[[1]]
lunge_events <- lunge_data[[2]]
```

### Visualize sensor and event data

`sb_plot_data()` produces an interactive figure for exploring bio-logger data.

```{r view_data, eval=FALSE}
deployid <- deployments(lunge_sensors)[1]
sb_plot_data(deployid, lunge_sensors, lunge_events)
```
